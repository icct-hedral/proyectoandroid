    <string name="txtNosotros">PlazaVea was born in 1993 with the name of Santa Isabel and ten years later we became part of the Intercorp Group, a group that gave us financial support to continue growing and seeking to improve the lives of more Peruvian families.

In 2007 we began our expansion in Peru, being the first to reach the provinces; achieving presence in 25 provinces of the coast, mountains and jungle; and today we have more than 100 stores for the comfort and satisfaction of more Peruvians.

In 2009 we were the first Peruvian chain to obtain the international HACCP certification for fresh food.

In 2012 we renewed our image seeking to refresh and adapt it to an increasingly modern and growing Peru.</string>
